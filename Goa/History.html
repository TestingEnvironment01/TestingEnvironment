            <h3>Tiswadi</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : Tiswadi along with the rest of Goa regularly exchanged hands between the Muslim Bhahmani Sultanate and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India prior to the 14th Century. By the 15th century, the Bijapur Sultanate under the Adil Shahi dynasty conquered Goa and it came under Muslim rule. The City of Goa was the regional capital of the Sultanates as well as a hub for the Hajj pilgrimage. The first temple to be built in Panjim was in the mid 1700s, when the Portuguese authorities granted permission to the Hindus to build their place of worship.</p>

            <h3>Ponda</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : There are many Hindu temples in and around Ponda. The Temples of Shri Manguesh (Shiva), Shri Nagesh, Shri Ganapati, Shri Ramnath and the Goddesses Shri Shantadurga, Shri Mahalasa, Shri Mahalaxmi are all located nearby.<br>- St. Anne Church, Ponda, Goa is called ‘Santa Ana Igreja em Ponda, Goa’ in Portuguese. The St. Anne Church, Ponda, Goa is popularly called ‘The Ponda Church’ locally in Goa. The original Church of Ponda, dedicated to St. Anne and St Anthony, was founded in 1700. Ponda was then a mission station administered by the Jesuits. The present Ponda Church was built later. The parish of Ponda was entrusted to the pastoral care of members of the Order of Franciscans Minor in 1957. The present parochial residence of the Ponda Church was built in 1967 and the church sanctuary was enlarged and remodeled in 1987.<br>- The historic Safa Masjid is a mosque built in 1560 by the Bijapur ruler Ibrahim Adil Shah I about 2  km from the center of Ponda. It is one of two sixteenth-century Islamic monuments in Goa that survived the Portuguese Inquisition.<br>- The village Bandivade in Ponda was established by King Sripala. He also built a Jain temple of Neminatha in Ponda.</p>

            <h3>Mormogao</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : When the Portuguese colonised part of Goa in the sixteenth century, they based their operations in the central district of Tiswadi, notably in the international emporium 'City of Goa', now Old Goa. As threats to their maritime supremacy increased, they built forts on various hillocks, especially along the coast. In 1624, they began to build their fortified town on the headland overlooking Mormugao harbour.<br>- The sultans of Bijapur, who had ruled Goa before the Portuguese, did not give up easily. There were several invasions. From the sea came the Dutch, who eventually took over from the Portuguese most of the coastal settlements: the Moluccas, Batticaloa, Trincomali, Galle, Malacca, Manar, Jaffna, Quilon, Cochin and Cannanore. From 1640 to 1643, the Dutch tried their best to capture Mormugão but were finally driven away.<br>- In 1683, the Portuguese in Goa were in grave danger from the Marathas. Almost certain defeat was averted when Sambhaji suddenly lifted siege and rushed to defend his own kingdom from the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The narrow escape, no less than the decline of the City of Goa, convinced the Portuguese viceroy, Dom Francisco de Távora, that he should shift the capital of the Portuguese holdings in India to Mormugao's formidable fortress.<br>- In 1685, the new city's principal edifices were under construction, with the Jesuit priest Father Teotónio Rebelo in charge. The Jesuit architects made a consistent effort to avoid the ornate style of the time. The austere viceregal palace still stands, having been used, after its short stint as a palace, in various capacities, including as the hotel which housed the British agents who in 1943 destroyed German ships anchored in Mormugao's neutral waters. Viceroys after Távora found Mormugao too secluded for their liking. The administrative headquarters were moved to the new city of Panjim, which is till today Goa's chief city.<br>- During World War II, the harbour of Mormugao was the site of Operation Creek, which resulted in the bombing of a German merchant ship, Ehrenfels, which had secretly been transmitting information to U-boats.</p>

            <h3>Salcette</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : King Viramarmadeva of the Kadamba dynasty issued a copper-plate inscription in 1049 CE concerning a grant of a piece of land called Tudukapura in Kudtarika agrahara of Chhat sathi desha. This inscription suggests that Chhat sathi refers to modern Salcete, known as "Sāṣṭī" in the local language.</p>

            <h3>Sanguem</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : The church in Sanguem is known as the Our Lady of Miracles church and was originally a military chapel built by the Portuguese Government and under the jurisdiction of the Zambaulim church. In 1951, the Sanguem taluka was declared as Mission and was handed over to Pilar fathers.</p>

            <h3>Quepem</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : The town was established by a Portuguese noble man Deão Jose Paulo de Almeida, the dean (Deão) of the church in AD 1787 after he moved there just five years after the conquest of Quepem sub-district by the Portuguese. He built his famous Palácio do Deão, followed by a public market, hospital, a church and other facilities for the benefit of the inhabitants through his own expense. He was later awarded the unofficial title of Barão de Quepem by the then viceroy D. Manuel Francisco Zacarias de Portugal e Castro.<br>- Quepem city before AD 1787 was a scattered settlement surrounded by thick jungle. It was situated in the princely state ruled by the Soonda's. When Hyder Ali began raiding and annexing the state, the princely family turned to the Portuguese who immediately took on Hyder Ali's forces and repelled them back, as well as financed the administration of the state. Having no heir to succeed, the then ruler gave complete control of the provinces to the Portuguese for their generosity in 1783. <br>- In AD 1787, Deaõ. Jose Paulo de Almeida transferred his residence from Old Goa to Quepem and founded a hamlet. Quepem was, in those days, covered with forest. He ordered the planting of rice, coconut palms and other fruit trees. He established a public market, hospital and other facilities for the benefit of the inhabitants. He also founded the Santa Cruz church, at his own cost, as inscribed on the pyramidal structure in the churchyard.<br>- It is believed that the Deão, began by erecting two columns at the entrance of Quepem. Thereafter, he obtained permission that criminal offenders who entered this village across these columns to work could rehabilitate themselves in this village which he had founded. Thus, he was able to establish Quepem as arable, self-sustaining and habitable place.<br>- It is not known the origin of this story, but one is able to still see the bases of these columns at the entrance of Quepem. He constructed in Quepem, for his occasional stay, a spacious house that he modestly described as a ‘Farm House’. It was later, justifiably, come to be known as the Palácio Do Deão.</p>

            <h3>Canacona</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : Canacona was incorporated into Goa in AD 1794. Like most of Goa, the culture of the district reflects an Indo-Portuguese fusion, yet Canacona experienced less Lusitanisation than the central Velhas Conquistas (Old Conquests) of Goa.</p>

            <h3>Dharbandora</h3>
            <p>- <u>History</u> : The creation of a new Dharbandora Taluka, the 12th Taluka in Goa, was announced by the Chief Minister of Goa Digambar Kamat on 25 March 2010, in his Budget Speech before the Goa Legislative Assembly. A Committee chaired by the Revenue Minister of Goa Jose Philip D'Souza steered the creation of the Taluka.<br>- By a notification dated 16 March 2011, the Government of Goa notified the 18 villages of Aglote, Bandoli, Camarconda, Caranzol, Codli, Colem, Cormonem, Darbandora, Gangem, Molem, Moissal, Piliem, Sancordem, Sangod, Sigao, Sonauli, Surla and Usgao to incorporate the Dharbandora Taluka. Gangem and Usgao were carved out from Ponda taluka while all the remaining villages were earlier a part of the Sanguem Taluka. However, there was resistance from the people of Gangem and Usgao villages against the decision of including both villages in the Dharbandora Taluka. Vide another notification dated 20 May 2011, the villages of Gangem and Usgao were reverted to Ponda taluka.<br>- Dharbandora Taluka came into existence as a part of the South Goa district on 4 April 2011. Satish R. Prabhu was the first Mamlatdar of the Dharbandora Taluka.</p>
